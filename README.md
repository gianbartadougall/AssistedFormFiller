# AssistedFormFiller

This project is a application geared at automating part of the proccess for Rental Agents to change the tenants at a rental property.

THE PROBLEM: 
When there is a change of tenants there is a bunch if forms that the agent must fill out as part of the legal procedure. The information to
fill out are things like names, bank info, postal addresses etc and this same information is needed on a lot of different forms. 

THE SOLUTION:
Instead of the agent having to fill out the same info mulitple times on each form, using this application you can create tenants, landlords
and houses with the information. Then whenever the agent needs to fill out a form they select the house and the tenant living in that 
property and the computer inserts all the information from that house and tenant/s into the form that they require which can then be saved
to the computer and printed or emailed.

Features
- add new tenants, owners and properties
- edit and delete existing tenants, owners and properties
- add new forms 
- supports mulitple tenants information per form
- save completed form to computer for emailing/printing
